# DevOS
Iâ€™ve been building a lightweight, modular Linux-based OS from scratch â€” called DevOS â€” a minimalist experience free from distraction
 - âœ… XFCE GUI
 - âœ… Rofi launcher
 - âœ… Micro, Neovim, Helix preinstalled
 - âœ… Chromium (GUI browser)
 - âœ… Custom home screen (WIP)
 - âœ… Fully compressed into initramfs.img â€” just boot and go!
 - âœ… Built from Alpine for size + speed
 - âœ… Internal build commands with custom shell commands
## ðŸ§  What I need help with:
- Code-server (VS Code in browser)
- Improving GUI experience (login managers, config theming)
- Boot & ISO automation scripts
- Advanced networking support
- Feature requests from other devs
- Test on real hardware / distros
## How to use
Download image from releases, unzip it and then use it
